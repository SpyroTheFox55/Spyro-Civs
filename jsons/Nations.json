This is because of your father pulling a few strings, foolishly hoping you'd help him consolidate power, not realizing your hatred of him and lack of education in the realm of politics. Despite your father's wishes, you tried your best to focus your efforts on helping your people and improving relations with other nations, among other things. In 1995, you decided to resign before the end of your term and pass the torch to a more capable candidate.",
